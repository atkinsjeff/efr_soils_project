### Overview

Data and analysis for EFR Soils project.

### From Data to Data Product
Below, we show the workflow from how we moved from soil horizon based measures (e.g., O, A, B horizons) to soil physical depth (0 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 40, and 40 - 100 cm depth horizons) for each analyte (Ca, K, Mg, P, N, total and organic C) and each additional soil chemical and physical property (bulk density, base saturation, soil texture, and soil pH).
